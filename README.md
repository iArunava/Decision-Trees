# Decision-Trees

This repository is my implementation of Decision Trees from scratch. 
No use of Machine Learning libraries. I even skipped on Pandas and Numpy.
So, basically everything is from scratch.

Sure the algorithm can be tuned at a lot of places for better results.
But, the point of this implementation is to get a clear idea about how the algorithm works :)

That said, I plan on improving my code as I learn new techniques.

# Accuracy and F1_Score

The model doesn't work great.

Using KCrossValidation using 3 folds, this is the output

```
[{'accuracy': 80.0, 'F1_score': 0.7377777777777778}, 
 {'accuracy': 81.69491525423729, 'F1_score': 0.773109243697479}, 
 {'accuracy': 41.01694915254237, 'F1_score': 0.35555555555555557}]
```
