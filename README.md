# Decision-Trees

This repository is my implementation of Decision Trees from scratch. 
No use of Machine Learning libraries. I even skipped on Pandas and Numpy.
So, basically everything is from scratch.

Sure the algorithm can be tuned at a lot of places for better results.
But, the point of this implementation is to get a clear idea about how the algorithm works :)

That said, I plan on improving my code as I learn new techniques.
